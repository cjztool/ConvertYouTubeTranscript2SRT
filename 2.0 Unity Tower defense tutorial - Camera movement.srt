1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
yeah

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
yeah

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
yeah

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
yeah

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
in this video we are going to be adding is moving to our camera as as you can

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
see up here

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
maybe it's a little hard but our level is larger than the actual cameras view

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
port here

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the line goes down here and here we would like to be able to move the camera

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
around here so that we can see the whole level so that we're not bound to make

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
levels that has the size of the camera width and height and so we can make a

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
slightly less one and we can just move around with the camera to place towers

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
on the map

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so to do this we will have to create a new script and the script should be

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
called camera movement so go to script folder right-click grade and see our

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
script and called camera movement

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
when you create that's what we need to write some code and basically this code

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
on goes right here is going to be very simple and so maybe you already know how

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to do all this but it will be more complicated later when we need to

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
restrict the bounds of the camera so that it can't go off the map but right

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
now we're just going to add the functionality so that it can actually

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
move in within the and outside the bounds from them as well

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so first of all we need a speed so make a private float called camera speed and

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
set it equal to 0 from the get-go because then considered in our inspector

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and and it just it from there

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when you have set to 0 we need to be able to see the inspector so we're going

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to serialize the field as we usually do when we need to access something from

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the inspector immunity

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so the next thing we are going to do is to create a functional private void get

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
input and this function here will take the place input and actually move the

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
camera around

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so first of all we need to make some if statements yet and this is the reason

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that I'm doing this is because it makes it easier for us to clamp their them

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
what's called the position later but for now make an if statement

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so if input that get key down key code to tell you if we press the w button

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
well then we say transformed to translate

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
it's a free that up x

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
camera speed

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
x time . Delta time I so

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ok so now we can actually move upwards and the point is that this translate

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
transform the translator will move the camera around on the screen based on

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
whatever we tell you to do in here inside the parameters

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
so we tell it to move upwards when first w button and we multiplied with the

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
camera speed and x time to time so time to time is the amount of time that has

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
passed since last time update was called and by multiplying by that

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
there we will talk account for the time so that the camera will move the same

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
speed on all your devices

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
so if we run mobile phone that hasn't it that isn't as powerful as computer in

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the home computer as I'm sitting out here at the camera might want faster on

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the computer

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
if we don't take the time into account so that's why we are multiplying but

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
time that Delta time anyway this was w we actually just copy and paste this

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
three times

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
underneath and then w.e this empty

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so now we have wasd and on a way of course me to go to the left so we write

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
left here on s way to go down and on

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
do you need to go to the right so now you actually have the code for moving

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the camera from side to side but right now we're not executing get input

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
anywhere but we need this code to be executed search executed we need to go

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
to update and right get input

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
like so so now we have our get input functionality and he needs that actually

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
we can write private here just to just put measure

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
so now we have the input function so if we save this and go to unity

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
well then this script here actually take the transformed to translate from it and

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
move the transform on the object it's sitting on and we wanted to move the

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
camera so we take the camera script and move it onto the camera so that it has

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that their script on it and if we just play the game now you will not be able

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to move anywhere and that's because the camera has zero speed

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so to give the camera some speed we can simply just a five for example and then

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
your camera is able to move but you can see here you can hold down the key

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you have to let go and click the key and to move around and that's because I

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
wrote some from quote i used input to get key down instead of get key

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so the code is only a secure right when we click the button

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
use the input that get you down which means this code here for moving the

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
camera gets executed right when employed press the key down and then it stops

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so we need to write get key instead

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
like so so we can replace all the gate key down with get key

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
there we go and then save and then we jump back to unity and remember to

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
select the main camera and put a speed if you didn't do it before because you

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
can see if i put five speed here and I stopped playing the game that it reverts

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
back to zero so i can put five before I play the game then it stays 5 and now i

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
can see and hold down the button here to pan around on the on the map here but

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
our movement is not restricted at all

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we can simply move all the edges of the of the man everything so we need to do

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
something so that we restrict the cameras movement

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
so let's try to do that so to make sure that our camera doesn't move over the

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
edges of our map we will have to make sure that we can take on screen

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
coordinates and translate them into world coordinates so that we know we

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
don't pass the edge of the map because if you look here you can see I know it's

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
very hard to see but we have our camera

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the white line here and this white line is never supposed to pass the bottom

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
right corner here because if you do so then does so then we can actually see

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that blue edge and on around on man we're not it

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we're not interested in that we would like the camera only to go to about here

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
something so that it never goes over the edge of the actual level and this will

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
be way more precise of course so that it doesn't go over at all on the map

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
so to do so we will have to understand how we could translate onto in

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
coordinates to world coordinates and you so we will have to use something called

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you to work in newport world . so we can take it . on our viewport and our

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
viewport is actually this white thing which year the y 2 square

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
so if you put is what we can see

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and we need to take the bottom right here and translate that into a well

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
coordinate so we know we don't exceed the living here in India and this is

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
just the unit's good preference here i'm just going to show you that if we look

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
at this view for space is normalized like this

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the bottom left of the camera is called 0.0 the top right is called 1.1

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
so if we look at that will see the bottom left is called 0.0

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
it's down here and just move this camera so right there

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and at this one up here is called 1.1 which means that this one down here

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,000
should be called 1.0 because one in 2010 and 1.1 and 1.0 over here

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
so this . 1.0 is what we need to get the actual world a coordinate from and we

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
need to translate it into a world space coordinate it your back to free and make

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
sure that that one doesn't exceed the limits here

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
so with that in place

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I hope you understand what we're going to do then we're going to write some

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
code

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
so open up your camera movement script and in here we need to create a new

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
function so make a private void set limits

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and I get my keys correctly and I can't let go and it needs to change in

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
something but we will handle that in a second

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
first of all we need the world coordinate of the right side of the

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
camera here so we go

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
one . not zero . zero then we go one out on the x-axis and we still in surround

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the y-axis so it's 1.0 here

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
so this is the point we need so we can say vector free

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:48,000
it's called p equals camera the main . viewport fort to world . we take our

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
camera and this actually access is the main camera and we need to take a point

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
on the viewport and the viewport . we need is a new litter free called in 1.0

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
to go

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
so this is the right bottom corner of the screen we translate into a

131
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
coordinate here which is saved in

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
it's got it's just going to be p world .

133
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
here we go ok so the next thing we need to do is to get the actual point of the

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
next I'll or the the amount of what's called in range we can move and to do

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that we'll have to access the actual tile down here

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we need to get this tile and calculate the distance from here to the camera so

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that we know how much we can actually move and the same goal from - from the

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
top here to the bottom because this little tile down here and here the point

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
right here is actually our limit right

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we need to get that . and make sure that this corner doesn't go over this corner

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
so

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
we need a victor free and it's called max tiles this is the position of that

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
make style

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
so we need an X limit and why limit

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
so let's go up here and make a private its limit

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
it's max it's called that research is going to be a float and then make a

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
private flowed called why mix so this is going to be a limit for the x value and

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
this is going to be the limit for the y value

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ok now we have some burgers to store this limited next thing we have to do is

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:51,000
to say the xmax people to make style . x minus the world . . x so if we take the

151
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
next house position

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
- the world . position then we have how much we can move right because we have a

153
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
tile somewhere say out here take that position - this position then we know

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
how much we can move and we have to do this implies so why max equal to the

155
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
next I'll y equals world . . of why go and let's save this

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
so now we have the functions were doing this but we need to call the set limits

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and set the next I'll so we will do this in a little bit in a smart way later

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
when we have added a helper class and everything but for now we just going to

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
use do it the easiest way

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
it's not the best way to do it and but it's the most ahead and wait for us

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
right now to do this thing

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
so if we go to the liver manager and then we have to add something to the

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
what do you call the crate level function here

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
let's find it right here and that means simply going to create a vector free

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,000
called max time you have to set it equal to break free . 0 if you don't do this

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
then it's going to complain and tell you that you're trying to use on and sign

167
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
variable so we just have to set it equal to something so down here when we place

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
a tile we actually gets the position down here when we set the transformer

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
station right here right in the playstyle function so every time we

170
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
place a tile we just return that we can return that position and when we're done

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
we always get the latest latest i'll because we start placing our tiles from

172
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the top down here all waited once like this and the last time child place is

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
always this one down here so this is not the best way as i told you to do this we

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
will do it in a better way where we only access the style right now we are going

175
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to set the max time position to equal to the next time we play so every time

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
replace a tile the next I'll will be equal to a new position and when we're

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
done it will end up with this is precision

178
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
so we can simply just rewrite our next I'll and see terms of its free and then

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
we simply need to

180
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
return new tile that transformed the position

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
so now it actually returns the position of the towel which is placed

182
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
so we can go up here and say next I'll equals this type of place to mix that

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
will now be equal to the towel we just play so now we will have the position of

184
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the actual child that we are going to and place in the end

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
now we need to use this map tile next aisle and give this feat this to the set

186
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
limits function here as you can see here we need the vector free next time

187
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and so we need to call that and to do so we can actually make a private camera

188
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and movement really wasn't that him a movement there

189
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
yeah so we have a camera movement up here and we can simply just socialize it

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
split it with with this with the childproof caps so we can see the

191
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
inspector and then we can go down here after our fall to peer just after it

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
not inside but after my camera movement that set limits and you can see we can

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
see set limits here

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that's because i made it private i think so go to camera movement and set limits

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
make it public like so and save and jump back to live in manager and right camera

196
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
movement again and set limits and then it needs the position which is max tile

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
go

198
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
so now we are executing the camera movements that limits and with we're

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
feeding at the next I'll hear them

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
yeah ok so this is not enough we need to add some functionality to the camera

201
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
movement and to make this work

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
so for example if we save this that right now and a jump to unity and select

203
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
our little manager here take the main camera and move the main camera into the

204
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
camera movement apart here and we start playing the game

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
well then we can still move

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
freely around here up and down and I can move too much to the left here and and

207
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
if you see then i'll still be able to move over in the right side here so this

208
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
doesn't didn't really change anything

209
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and why is that well we're not using the limits for anything right now

210
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
so we have to jump back into the script and go to camera movement and down here

211
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
we have to write some coach you limit the movement of the camera so we have to

212
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
use a clamp to claim the movement

213
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
so we can actually say transform that position equals new Victor free so we

214
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
take the position after we have moved the camera up here we take and clamp the

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
position by saying math if the clamp and clamping is in the way of making sure

216
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that value doesn't exceed it

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
these are the values we put in here so we can't the position to a new vector

218
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
free where we use transform position X and it shouldn't be able to go below

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
zero and it shouldn't be able to go or x max here and then the Y value should be

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:51,000
mass eff . claimed that a strange form the position that why command 0 , max

221
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
cool and actually it shouldn't be wimax because we're going down

222
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
so actually we should we should actually rename this one click on it press of two

223
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and ride

224
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
why minimum instead of Max and then we should use it as the minimum value here

225
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
as you can see what I'm riding here it asks for the minimum value which is why

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
minimum and 0 because yeah I for that we're going downward so we should switch

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
it's not my maximum is not the top with the bottom we are looking at button of

228
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
tile as you remember

229
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
ok so now we have something that sets the limit

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
so if we save this

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and jump back into unity then there's still some problems as you can see now

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
we can't even see anything here but i am one on there on this front I'll see what

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't see anything

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and the reason of that is because the sea position here of the camera is 0 and

235
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
keep setting it to 0 you can even change it to something else

236
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
so we need to make sure that our is the position here is a example - 10 so we

237
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
give the better for a year after your comment - -

238
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
now we set the MC position as - 10 so that we can go here

239
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
play the game and now you can see you imagine because the camera is further

240
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
away from the task force on top of the tiles and then the tires go through the

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
camera can't see them so now we just climate in in climbing into this

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
position here is that but i'm not able to move quickly around as you can see

243
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
here

244
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm missing one length of the tiles here

245
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not going to the pitch you have to see but i'm going to this edge and I

246
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
can't move out but that's fine but i can move to for far down and and I and I'm

247
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
fine so over-the-top the left side on the top side is correct but the bottom

248
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and the right side is wrong

249
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
so we need to do something here and that's inside our little manager when we

250
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
set the limits

251
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
we are missing something we need to use the width of the tiles to make sure that

252
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
we actually use the correct values so we need to say knew Victor free and we need

253
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
to share

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
next I'll 2x plus tile size ,

255
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
next I'll . why - tile size

256
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
so these are the values so now we're creating a new vector free as the next

257
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
i'll be using the next position posted

258
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Plus tile size so we get that extra tile size out and as you can see we were

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
going too far down as you can see here we were missing one tile

260
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,000
so we need to

261
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that's how sighs to the limits and as you can see here we are going to far

262
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
down so we need to reduce the amount of space we can move down there with the

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
height of the size of these tiles

264
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
so , -

265
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
tile size that that - nice to have that why - tile size here so let's try to

266
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
save this and jump back into unity and we run the game

267
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
so if we run the game now

268
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you could see that the x value here fits perfectly it goes to the edge here and

269
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it can go up but if you go down you're still able to move too far down to need

270
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to figure out why we can exceed the limits in the button and I have an idea

271
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
why but let's take a look at it and figure out what's wrong because we're

272
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
going way too far down here so let's try to open them

273
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
the camera movement script find the arrow and I always see the arrow here in

274
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
my set limits function i wrote my style y equals vp that why so it should be

275
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
- year repeat that why and its trying to save it again

276
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
so now it should actually calculate the minimum value of y better

277
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
maybe you already caught this earlier when i was writing this and maybe you're

278
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
screaming at just waiting for me to change it but yeah now I tested it now

279
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
figure out that this was the problem so jump back into unity run your game right

280
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
here and now you shouldn't be able to go to that they're too far here

281
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
so as you can see here now the limits I actually correct

282
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
you can't go over the right edge you can't go over the bottom image and you

283
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
can't go over the top and the and the left side here

284
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
so now we have a camera that can pen and round on our level no matter how large

285
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
it will get and so that's it for this video in the next video will start

286
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
adding some more functionality for and

287
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
the actual gameplay i think but let's see what we're going to do and thank you
